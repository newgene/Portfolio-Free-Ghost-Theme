# My(BioThings)-specific theme adjustments
How the iframe-containing custom pages work:
A page is created with a descriptive stub/slug name via the admin panel
Copy/paste an existing page-slug.hbs and replace the slug name
Return to the admin panel and change the title to the url which will be the source of the iframe
Take care NOT to change the existing url of the page itself (should still keep the slug name)
The iframe on that custom page should automatically pull the url from the page title.

Color-specific theme changes: these changes were applied to the main.css insteady of using !important primarily because !important will override the color in any inherited elements which breaks some of the intended style features. It's easier/less messy to just do a batch find/replace of color: #5cc1a9 
with: 
#4082e2 for MyGene
#40B307 for MyVariant
#FD7400 for MyChem

## Important information

This theme contains a few features which may require some additional knowledge or settings.

### Featured images/videos

The image or video placed at the beginning of the post will be used as a featured image/video on the post list. Additionally if you want to display the post over the title on the post page, you have to set the alternative text of the image to **featured-image**.

In theory you can use different images as a featured image on the posts’ list and on the post page (in this case you can add the **featured-image** alternative text to a different image).

The videos will be responsive thanks to the fitvids jQuery plugin.

### Disqus comments

You can specify your Disqus username in the **partials/config.hbs** file in the following line:

```js
var disqus_shortname = '';
```

### Google Analytics support

You can specify your Google Analytics tracking code ID in the **partials/config.hbs** file in the following line:

```js
var ga_ua = 'UA-XXXXX-X';
```

### Background image

The image displayed in the background can be a blog cover image which can be defined in the Ghost settings. As default there is a grey background displayed.

### Footer area

You can modify the content of the page footer in the **partials/footer.hbs** file. It will be displayed on all subpages of your Ghost blog.
